Revision history for Riap

1.1.11	 2012-04-03

         + (REMOVED) Remove mention of 'riap+http' and 'riap+https' as they are
           useless. Use 'http' and 'https'.


1.1.10	 2012-04-03

         + (Change, or rather define, as it has not been specified formally)
           'pm' URI scheme to (or, as) 'pl'.


1.1.9	 2012-03-08

         + Add new action for variable: get


1.1.8	 2012-03-01

         + Add new action for package: child_metas

         + HTTP: Add new action: srvinfo

         + HTTP: The valid values of 'fmt' is now up to the implementation
           (except that 'json' still needs to be supported).


1.1.7	 2012-02-22

         + (REMOVE, INCOMPATIBLE) Remove action 'complete_arg_name'. This action
           can be implemented in the client side by retrieving function metadata
           using 'meta' action (this requires larger bandwidth, but clients can
           do caching). It is better to implement this on the client side due to
           specific requirements like --foo vs -foo, --boolopt as well as
           --noboolopt (or --no-boolopt), and so on.


1.1.6	 2012-02-22

         + Add new action 'actions'. To list available actions on a code entity,
           use this action now instead of 'info'.

         + (INCOMPATIBLE) Rename 'complete' action to 'complete_arg_val'.

         + Add new action 'complete_arg_name'.


1.1.5	 2012-02-15

         Some fixes (build/deps, examples, 'info' action should contain 'acts')
         and minor updates.


1.1.4	 2012-02-01

         + Declare that in 1.1 series, minor backward compatibility problems
           between revisions are to be expected.

         + Make 'v' request key optional, defaults to 1.1.

         + Rename 'ofmt' request key to 'fmt'.

         + Change required result keys of 'info' action.


1.1.3	 2012-01-27

	 + Specify riap URI scheme (moved from Rinci).

         + Add Riap::TCP.


1.1.2	 2012-01-17

	 Rename distribution from Rinci-HTTP as Riap.


1.1.1    2012-01-15

         No spec changes. Fix misplaced section in POD.


1.1.0    2012-01-15

         First release. Renamed from Sub::Spec::HTTP. Now follow the Rinci
         specification instead of Sub::Spec. Generalized to perform actions on
         any code entities instead of just functions. Change terminologies.
